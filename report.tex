\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

(Delete and Replace): This report will document your learning throughout the course. It will be a collection of your notes, homework solutions, and critical reflections on the content of the course. Something in between a semester-long take home exam and your own lecture notes.\footnote{One purpose of giving the report the form of lecture notes is that self-explanation is a technique proven to help with learning, see Chapter 6 of Craig Barton, How I Wish I'd Taught Maths, and references therein. In fact, the report can lead you from self-explanation (which is what you do for the weekly deadline) to explaining to others (which is what you do for the final submission). Another purpose is to help those of you who want to go on to graduate school to develop some basic writing skills. A report that you could proudly add to your application to graduate school (or a job application in industry) would give you full points.}

To modify this template you need to modify the source \texttt{report.tex} which is available in the course repo. For guidance on how to do this read both the source and the pdf of \texttt{latex-example.tex} which is also available in the repo. Also check out the usual resources (Google, Stackoverflow, LLM, etc). It was never as easy as now to learn a new programming lanugage (which, btw, \LaTeX{} is).

For writing \LaTeX{} with VSCode use the \href{https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop}{LaTeX Workshop} extension. 

There will be deadlines during the semester, graded mostly for completeness. That means that you will get the points if you submit in time and are on the right track, independently of whether the solutions are technically correct. You will have the opportunity to revise your work for the final submission of the full report.

The full report is due at the end of the finals week. It will be graded according to the following guidelines.

Grading  guidelines (see also below):
\begin{itemize}
\item Is typesetting and layout professional? 
\item Is the technical content, in particular the homework, correct?
\item Did the student find interesting references~\cite{bla} and cites them throughout the report?
\item Do the notes reflect understanding and critical thinking?
\item Does the report contain material related to but going beyond what we do in class?
\item Are the questions interesting?
\end{itemize}

Do not change the template (fontsize, width of margin, spacing of lines, etc) without asking your first.

\section{Week by Week}\label{homework}

\subsection{Week 1}

\subsubsection*{Notes}
This week in class we mainly focused on learning Lean, setting up \LaTeX, and a brief lecture on the basis of $Proof = Program$. This idea shows how logical mathematical proofs are a constructive process, building on previously founded theorems and definitions. This idea transfers to theoretical programming in the sense that programs are also constructed proofs. The execution of a program is the execution of many logical steps in a proof. I enjoy how this relates to the "human" process as well - our activities are the execution of previously learned strategies in a logical way.
\subsubsection*{Homework}

  \subsubsection*{Level 5 - Adding Zero}
  In this level we prove the theorem that $\textbf{a+0=a}$ using $\textbf{a+(b+0)+(c+0)=a+b+c}$. Here is how I solved this theorem.

  \bgroup\obeylines
  \qquad \textbf{repeat rw add zero}
  \qquad \textbf{rfl}
  \egroup

  \subsubsection*{Level 6 - Adding Zero}
  In this level we built on the solution from the previous level to learn how to use precision rewriting.

  \bgroup\obeylines
  \qquad \textbf{rw add zero c}
  \qquad \textbf{repeat rw add zero}
  \qquad \textbf{rfl}
  \egroup

  \subsubsection*{Level 7 - Add Suc}
  In this level we prove the theorem that $\textbf{succ(a)=a+1}$.

  \bgroup\obeylines
  \qquad \textbf{rw one eq add zero}
  \qquad \textbf{repeat rw add zero}
  \qquad \textbf{rfl}
  \egroup

  \subsubsection*{Level 8 - Add Suc}
  In this level we prove the equation that $\textbf{2+2=4}$. This was the final level in the Tutorial World, and required the accumulation of definitions and theorems learned so far. I will provide the assumptions that I used when deciding my proof in Lean.

  \bgroup\obeylines
  \qquad \textbf{rw four eq succ three} —— Any number $n = succ(pred(n))$
  \qquad \textbf{rw three eq succ two}  —— Any number $n = succ(pred(n))$
  \qquad \textbf{rw two eq succ one}    —— Any number $n = succ(pred(n))$
  \qquad \textbf{rw one eq succ zero}   —— Any number $n = succ(pred(n))$
  \qquad \textbf{repeat rw add succ}    —— Using $a + succ b = succ (a + b)$
  \qquad \textbf{rw add zero}           —— Using $a + 0 = a$
  \qquad \textbf{rfl}                   —— Proves the goal $X = X$

  \egroup

%In case you want to draw automata in Latex, you can use the tikz %package. Here is an example of a simple automaton:
%
%\begin{tikzpicture}[shorten >=1pt,node distance=2cm,on grid,auto] 
%  \node[state] (q_1)   {$q_1$}; 
%  \node[state] (q_2) [above right=of q_1] {$q_2$}; 
%  \node[state] (q_3) [below right=of q_2] {$q_3$}; 
%   \path[->] 
%   (q_1) edge  node {0} (q_2)
%         edge  node [swap] {1} (q_3)
%   (q_2) edge  node  {1} (q_3)
%         edge [loop above] node {0} ()
%   (q_3) edge [loop below] node {0,1} ();
%\end{tikzpicture}
%
%By the way, GPT-4 is quite good at outputting tikz code.

\subsubsection*{Comments and Questions}

%(Delete and Replace:) Here you should write your own critical reflection on the content of the week. If you can surprise me with something I have not seen before, you are on the right track.

%I expect you to read the lecture notes. 

Ask at least one \textbf{interesting question}\footnote{It is important to learn to ask \emph{interesting} questions. There is no precise way of defining what is meant by interesting. You can only learn this by doing. An interesting question comes typically in two parts. Part 1 (one or two sentences) sets the scene. Part 2 (one or two sentences) asks the question. A good question strikes the right balance between being specific and technical on the one hand and open ended on the other hand. A question that can be answered with yes/no is not an interesing question.} on the lecture notes. Also post the question on the Discord channel so that everybody can see and discuss the questions.

\subsection{Week 2}

\subsubsection*{Notes}
Translating Lean into Math by matching each line in Lean to the corresponding mathematical equation and assumptions. Being able to reverse the proof and translate from Math into Lean is also important. Lean reads from the goal to the axioms, whereas Math is written from the axioms to the goal (usually).
\newline \newline Defining data types recursively (in terms of itself). Syntax varies by language. 
\newline \newline Recursion example with the Tower of Hanoi. Breaking logical puzzles into iterative steps, then into recursive steps.


%(Delete:) Week 2 (and all the other weeks) should follow the same pattern as Week 1. Even if there is a week without homework, notes and comments (see above) are still expected.

\section{Lessons from the Assignments}

(Delete and Replace): Write three pages about your individual contributions to the project.

On 3 pages you describe lessons you learned from the project. Be as technical and detailed as possible. Particularly valuable are \emph{interesting} examples where you connect concrete technical details with \emph{interesting} general observations or where the theory discussed in the lectures helped with the design or implementation of the project.

Write this section during the semester. This is approximately a quarter of apage per week and the material should come from the work you do anyway. Just keep your eyes open for interesting lessons.

Make sure that you use \LaTeX{} to structure your writing (eg by using subsections).

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

(Delete and Replace): (approx 400 words) A critical reflection on the content of the course. Step back from the technical details. How does the course fit into the wider world of software engineering? What did you find most interesting or useful? What improvements would you suggest?
